Introduction

by Eva S. Dowling, Ph.D., Scribe to the Messenger

The full title of this book is "The Aquarian Age Gospel of Jesus, the Christ of the Piscean Age," and the critical reader is apt to ask a number of pertinent questions concerning it.  Among the many anticipated questions these are perhaps the most important:

1 What is an Age?
2 What is the Piscean Age?
3 What is the Aquarian Age?
4 What is meant by the Christ as the word is used in this book?
5 What relationship existed between Jesus of Nazareth and the Christ?
6 Who is Levi, the transcriber of this book?
7 What are the Akashic Records?

1 What is an Age?  Astronomers tell us that our sun and his family of
planets resolve around a central sun, which is millions of miles
distant, and that it requires something less than 26000 years to make
one revolution.  His orbit is called the Zodiac, which is divided into
twelve signs, familiarly known as Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo,
Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces.
It requires our Solar System a little more than 2100 years to pass
through one of these signs, and this time is the measurement of an Age
or Dispensation.  Because of what astronomers call "the Precession of
the Equinoxes" the movement of the sun through the signs of the Zodiac
is in order reverse from that given above.

Exact Time of the Beginning of an Age. Regarding this matter there is
a disagreement among astronomers; but in this Introduction we are not
called upon to give the reasons of the various investigators for their
opinions; there are enough well-authenticated facts for our present
purposes.  It is conceded by all critical students that the sun
entered the zodiacal sign Taurus in the days of our historic Adam when
the Taurian Age began; that Abraham lived not far from the beginning
of the Arian Age, when the sun entered the sign Aries.  About the time
of the rise of the Roman empire the sun entered the sign Pisces, the
Fishes, and the Piscean Age began, so that early in this Age Jesus of
Nazareth lived.

2 What is the Piscean Age?  This question requires further
consideration.  The Piscean Age is identical with the Christian
Dispensation.  The word `Pisces' means `fish'.  The sign is known as a
water sign, and the Piscean Age has been distinctly the age of the
fish and its element, water.

In the establishment of their great institutions, John the Harbinger
and Jesus both introduced the rite of water baptism, which has been
used in some form in all the so-called Christian Churches and cults,
even to the present time.  Water is the true symbol of purification.
Jesus himself said to the Harbinger before he was baptized: "All the
men must be washed, symbolic of the cleansing of the soul." (Aquarian
Gospel 64:7)

Fish was a Christian Symbol.  In the earlier centuries of the
Christian Dispensation the fish was everywhere used as a symbol.  In
his remarkable book, "Christian Iconography," Didron says:

"The fish, in the opinion of antiquarians generally, is the symbol of
Jesus Christ.  The fish is sculptured upon a number of Christian
monuments, and more particularly upon the ancient sarcophagi.  It is
also upon medals, bearing the name of our Savior and also upon
engraved stones, cameos and intaglios.  The fish is also to be
remarked upon the amulets worn suspended from the necks by children,
and upon ancient glasses and sculptured lamps.

"Baptismal fonts are more particularly ornamented with the fish.  The
fish is constantly exhibited placed upon a dish in the middle of the
table, at the Last Supper, among the loaves, knives and cups used at
the banquet."

In the writings of Tertullian we find this statement: "We are little
fishes in Christ our great fish."

The last two thousand years, comprising the Piscean Age, has certainly
been one of water and the many uses of that element have been
emphasized, and sea and lake and river navigation has been brought to
a high degree of efficiency.

3 What is the Aquarian Age? The human race is today standing upon the
cusp of the Piscean-Aquarian Ages.  Aquarius is an air sign and the
New Age is already noted for remarkable inventions for the use of air,
electricity, magnetism, etc.  Men navigate the air as fish do the sea,
and send their thoughts spinning around the world with the speed of
lightning.

The word `Aquarius' is derived from the Latin word `aqua', meaning
`water'.  Aquarians is, however, the `water bearer', and the symbol of
the sign, which is the eleventh sign of the Zodiac, is a man carrying
in his right hand a pitcher of water.  Jesus referred to the beginning
of the Aquarian Age in these words:

"And then the man who bears the pitcher will walk forth across an arc
of heaven; the sign and signet of the Son of Man will stand forth in
the eastern sky.  The wise will then lift up their heads and know that
the redemption of the earth is near." (Aquarian Gospel 157:29,30)

The Aquarian Age is preeminently a spiritual age, and the spiritual
side of the great lessons that Jesus gave to the world may now be
comprehended by multitudes of people, for the many are now coming into
an advanced stage of spiritual consciousness; so with much propriety
this book is called "The Aquarian (or Spiritual) Gospel of Jesus, the
Christ."

An Important Event. The transfer of dominion from one Age to another
is an important event in the world of Cherubim and Seraphim.  Among
the manuscripts of Levi we have found a most remarkable paper
describing the transfer of dominion from the Piscean Age to the
Aquarian Age, but it is difficult to determine whether it is a recital
of facts or a prophetic statement.  We reproduce the paper in full.

THE CUSP OF THE AGES

In Spirit I was caught away into the realms of Akasha; I stood alone
within the circle of the sun.

And there I found the scret spring that opens up the door to Wisdom
and an understanding heart.

I entered in and then I knew.

I saw the four and twenty Cherubim and Seraphim that guard the circle
of the sun, the mightly ones who were proclaimed by masters long ago
"the four and twenty ancient ones."

I heard the names of every Cherubim and Seraphim, and learned that
every sign in all the Zodiac is ruled by two -- a Cherubim and
Seraphim.

And then I stood upon the cusp where Ages meet.  The Piscean Age had
passed; the Aquarian Age had just begun.

I saw the guardian Spirits of the Piscean Age; Ramasa is the Cherubim;
Vacabiel is Seraphim.

I saw the guardian Spirits of the Aquarian Age, and Archer is the
Cherubim; Sakmaquil is the Seraphim.

These four great spirits of the Triune God stood close together on the
cusp, and in the presence of the sacred Three -- the God of Might, the
God of Wisdom, and the God of Love -- the scepter of Domain, of Might,
of Wisdom and of Love was there transferred.

I heard the charges of the Triune God; but these I may not now reveal.

I heard the history of the Piscean Age from Piscean Cherubim and
Seraphim, and when I took my pen to write, Ramasa said:

"Not now, my son, not now; but you may write it down for men when men
have learned the sacred laws of Brotherhood, of Peace on earth, good
will to every living thing."

And then I heard the Aquarian Cherubim and Seraphim proclaim the
Gospel of the coming Age, the age of Wisdom, of the Son of Man.

And when the crown was lifted from the head of Ramasa and placed upon
the head of Archer of the Aquarian age; and when the royal scepter was
transferred from Seraphim Vacabiel to Seraphim Sakmaquil there was
deep silence in the courts of heaven.

And then the goddess Wisdom spoke, and with her hands outstretched she
poured the benedictions of the Holy Breath upon the rules of Aquarius.

I may not write the words she spoke, but I may tell the Gospel of the
coming age that Archer told when he received the crown.

And I may breathe to men the song of praise that Seraphim Sakmaquil
sung when she received the royal scepter of the newborn age.

This Gospel I will tell, and I will sing this song in every land, to
all the people, tribes and tongues of earth.
