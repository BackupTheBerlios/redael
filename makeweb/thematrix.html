            At the beginning of <i>The Matrix</i>, a black-clad computer hacker 
            known as Neo falls asleep in front of his computer. A mysterious message 
            appears on the screen: &quot;Wake up, Neo.&quot;<a name="onetext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup></font> 
            This succinct phrase encapsulates the plot of the film, as Neo struggles 
            with the problem of being imprisoned in a &quot;material&quot; world 
            that is actually a computer simulation program created in the distant 
            future by Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a means of enslaving humanity, 
            by perpetuating ignorance in the form of an illusory perception called 
            &quot;the Matrix.&quot; In part, the film crafts its ultimate view 
            of reality by alluding to numerous religious traditions that advance 
            the idea that the fundamental problem which humanity faces is ignorance 
            and the solution is knowledge or awakening. Two religious traditions 
            on which the film draws heavily are Gnostic Christianity and Buddhism.<a name="twotext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup></font> 
            Although these traditions differ in important ways, they agree in 
            maintaining that the problem of ignorance can be solved through an 
            individual's reorientation of perspective concerning the material 
            realm.<a name="threetext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup></font> 
            Gnostic Christianity and Buddhism also both envision a guide who helps 
            those still trapped in the limiting world of illusion, a Gnostic redeemer 
            figure or a bodhisattva, who willingly enters that world in order 
            to share liberating knowledge, facilitating escape for anyone able 
            to understand. In the film, this figure is Neo, whose name is also 
            an anagram for the &quot;One.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Although as a &quot;modern myth&quot;<a name="fourtext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup></font> 
            the film purposefully draws on numerous traditions,<a name="fivetext"></a><font size=-2><sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup></font> 
            we propose that an examination of Gnostic Christianity and Buddhism 
            well illuminates the overarching paradigm of <i>The Matrix</i>, namely, 
            the problem of sleeping in ignorance in a dreamworld, solved by waking 
            to knowledge or enlightenment. By drawing syncretistically on these 
            two ancient traditions and fusing them with a technological vision 
            of the future, the film constructs a new teaching that challenges 
            its audience to question &quot;reality.&quot;</p>
          <p CLASS="largeregular" align="center"><b>I. Christian Elements in <i>The 
            Matrix</i></b></p>
          <p CLASS="largeregular" align="left">The majority of the film's audience 
            probably easily recognizes the presence of some Christian elements, 
            such as the name Trinity<a name="sixtext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup></font> 
            or Neo's death and Christ-like resurrection and ascension near the 
            end of the film. In fact, Christian and biblical allusions abound, 
            particularly with respect to nomenclature:<a name="seventext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup></font> 
            Apoc (Apocalypse), Neo's given name of Mr. Ander/son (from the Greek 
            andras for man, thus producing &quot;Son of Man&quot;), the ship named 
            the Nebuchadnezzar (the Babylonian king who, in the Book of Daniel, 
            has puzzling symbolic dreams that must be interpreted),<a name="eighttext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup></font> 
            and the last remaining human city, Zion, synonymous in Judaism and 
            Christianity with (the heavenly) Jerusalem.<a name="ninetext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup></font> 
            Neo is overtly constructed as a Jesus figure: he is &quot;the One&quot; 
            who was prophesied to return again to the Matrix, who has the power 
            the change the Matrix from within (i.e., to work miracles), who battles 
            the representatives of evil and who is killed but comes to life again. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This construction of Neo as Jesus is reinforced in numerous ways. 
            Within minutes of the commencement of the movie, another hacker says 
            to Neo, &quot;You're my savior, man, my own personal Jesus Christ.&quot;<a name="tentext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#ten">10</a></sup></font> 
            This identification is also suggested by the Nebuchadnezzar's crew, 
            who nervously wonder if he is &quot;the One&quot; who was foretold, 
            and who repeatedly swear in Neo's presence by saying &quot;Jesus&quot; 
            or &quot;Jesus Christ.&quot;<a name="eleventext"></a><font size=-2><sup><a href="#eleven">11</a></sup></font> 
            In still another example, Neo enters the Nebuchadnezzar for the first 
            time and the camera pans across the interior of the ship, resting 
            on the make: &quot;Mark III no. 11.&quot; This seems to be another 
            messianic reference, since the Gospel of Mark 3:11 reads: &quot;Whenever 
            the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and shouted, 
            ' You are the Son of God!'&quot;</p>
          <p CLASS="largeregular" align="center"><b>II. Gnosticism in <i>The Matrix</i></b></p>
          <p CLASS="largeregular" align="left">Although the presence of individual 
            Christian elements within the film is clear, the overall system of 
            Christianity that is presented is not the traditional, orthodox one. 
            Rather, the Christian elements of the film make the most sense when 
            viewed within a context of Gnostic Christianity.<a name="twelvetext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#twelve">12</a></sup></font> 
            Gnosticism was a religious system that flourished for centuries at 
            the beginning of the Common Era, and in many regions of the ancient 
            Mediterranean world it competed strongly with &quot;orthodox&quot; 
            Christianity, while in other areas it represented the only interpretation 
            of Christianity that was known.<a name="thirteentext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup></font> 
            The Gnostics possessed their own Scriptures, accessible to us in the 
            form of the Nag Hammadi Library, from which a general sketch of Gnostic 
            beliefs may be drawn.<a name="fourteentext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup></font> 
            Although Gnostic Christianity comprises many varieties, Gnosticism 
            as a whole seems to have embraced an orienting cosmogonic myth that 
            explains the true nature of the universe and humankind's proper place 
            in it.<a name="fifteentext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup></font> 
            A brief retelling of this myth illuminates numerous parallels with 
            The Matrix.<br>
            <br>
            In the Gnostic myth, the supreme god is completely perfect and therefore 
            alien and mysterious, &quot;ineffable,&quot; &quot;unnamable,&quot; 
            &quot;immeasurable light which is pure, holy and immaculate&quot; 
            (Apocryphon of John). In addition to this god there are other, lesser 
            divine beings in the pleroma (akin to heaven, a division of the universe 
            that is not Earth), who possess some metaphorical gender of male or 
            female.<a name="sixteentext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup></font> 
            Pairs of these beings are able to produce offspring that are themselves 
            divine emanations, perfect in their own ways.<a name="seventeentext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#seventeen">17</a></sup></font> 
            A problem arises when one &quot;aeon&quot; or being named Sophia (Greek 
            for wisdom), a female, decides &quot;to bring forth a likeness out 
            of herself without the consent of the Spirit,&quot; that is, to produce 
            an offspring without her consort (Apocry. of John). The ancient view 
            was that females contribute the matter in reproduction, and males 
            the form; thus, Sophia's action produces an offspring that is imperfect 
            or even malformed, and she casts it away from the other divine beings 
            in the pleroma into a separate region of the cosmos. This malformed, 
            ignorant deity, sometimes named Yaldaboath, mistakenly believes himself 
            to be the only god.<br>
            <br>
            Gnostics identify Yaldabaoth as the Creator God of the Old Testament, 
            who himself decides to create archons (angels), the material world 
            (Earth) and human beings. Although traditions vary, Yaldabaoth is 
            usually tricked into breathing the divine spark or spirit of his mother 
            Sophia that formerly resided in him into the human being (especially 
            Apocry. of John; echoes of Genesis 2-3). Therein lies the human dilemma. 
            We are pearls in the mud, a divine spirit (good) trapped in a material 
            body (bad) and a material realm (bad). Heaven is our true home, but 
            we are in exile from the pleroma.<br>
            <br>
            Luckily for the Gnostic, salvation is available in the form of gnosis 
            or knowledge imparted by a Gnostic redeemer, who is Christ, a figure 
            sent from the higher God to free humankind from the Creator God Yaldabaoth. 
            The gnosis involves an understanding of our true nature and origin, 
            the metaphysical reality hitherto unknown to us, resulting in the 
            Gnostic's escape (at death) from the enslaving material prison of 
            the world and the body, into the upper regions of spirit. However, 
            in order to make this ascent, the Gnostic must pass by the archons, 
            who are jealous of his/her luminousity, spirit or intelligence, and 
            who thus try to hinder the Gnostic's upward journey.<br>
            <br>
            To a significant degree, the basic Gnostic myth parallels the plot 
            of <i>The Matrix</i>, with respect to both the problem that humans 
            face as well as the solution. Like Sophia, we conceived an offspring 
            out of our own pride, as Morpheus explains: &quot;Early in the 21st 
            century, all of mankind was united in celebration. We marveled at 
            our own magnificence as we gave birth to AI.&quot;<a name="eighteentext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup></font> 
            This offspring of ours, however, like Yaldabaoth is malformed (matter 
            without spirit?). Morpheus describes AI as &quot;a singular consciousness 
            that spawned an entire race of machines,&quot; a fitting parallel 
            for the Gnostic Creator God of the archons (angels) and the illusory 
            material world. AI creates the Matrix, a computer simulation that 
            is &quot;a prison for your mind.&quot; Thus, Yaldabaoth/ AI traps 
            humankind in a material prison that does not represent ultimate reality, 
            as Morpheus explains to Neo: &quot;As long as the Matrix exists, the 
            human race will never be free.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            The film also echoes the metaphorical language employed by Gnostics. 
            The Nag Hammadi texts describe the fundamental human problem in metaphorical 
            terms of blindness, sleep, ignorance, dreams and darkness / night, 
            while the solution is stated in terms of seeing, waking, knowledge 
            (gnosis), waking from dreams and light / day.<a name="nineteentext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a></sup></font><br>
            <br>
            Similarly, in the film Morpheus, whose name is taken from the Greek 
            god of sleep and dreams, reveals to Neo that the Matrix is &quot;a 
            computer generated dreamworld.&quot; When Neo is unplugged and awakens 
            for the first time on the Nebuchadnezzar in a brightly lit white space 
            (a cinematic code for heaven), his eyes hurt, as Morpheus explains, 
            because he has never used them. Everything Neo has &quot;seen&quot; 
            up to that point was seen with the mind's eye, as in a dream, created 
            through software simulation. Like an ancient Gnostic, Morpheus explains 
            that the blows he deals Neo in the martial arts training program have 
            nothing to do with his body or speed or strength, which are illusory. 
            Rather, they depend only on his mind, which is real. <br>
            <br>
            The parallels between Neo and Christ sketched earlier are further 
            illuminated by a Gnostic context, since Neo is &quot;saved&quot; through 
            gnosis or secret knowledge, which he passes on to others. Neo learns 
            about the true structure of reality and about his own true identity, 
            which allows him to break the rules of the material world he now perceives 
            to be an illusion. That is, he learns that &quot;the mind makes it 
            [the Matrix, the material world] real,&quot; but it is not ultimately 
            real. In the final scene of the film, it is this gnosis that Neo passes 
            on to others in order to free them from the prison of their minds, 
            the Matrix. He functions as a Gnostic Redeemer, a figure from another 
            realm who enters the material world in order to impart saving knowledge 
            about humankind's true identity and the true structure of reality, 
            thereby setting free anyone able to understand the message. <br>
            <br>
            In fact, Neo's given name is not only Mr. Anderson / the Son of Man, 
            it is Thomas Anderson, which reverberates with the most famous Gnostic 
            gospel, the Gospel of Thomas. Also, before he is actualized as Neo 
            (the one who will initiate something &quot;New,&quot; since he is 
            indeed &quot;the One&quot;), he is doubting Thomas, who does not believe 
            in his role as the redeemer figure.<a name="twentytext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#twenty">20</a></sup></font> 
            In fact, the name Thomas means &quot;the Twin,&quot; and in ancient 
            Christian legend he is Jesus' twin brother. In a sense, the role played 
            by Keanu Reeves has a twin character, since he is constructed as both 
            a doubting Thomas and as a Gnostic Christ figure.<a name="twentyonetext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#twentyone">21</a></sup></font><br>
            <br>
            Not only does Neo learn and pass on secret knowledge that saves, in 
            good Gnostic fashion, but the way in which he learns also evokes some 
            elements of Gnosticism. Imbued with images from eastern traditions, 
            the training programs teach Neo the concept of &quot;stillness,&quot; 
            of freeing the mind and overcoming fear, cinematically captured in 
            &quot;Bullet Time&quot; (digitally mastered montages of freeze frames 
            / slow motion frames using multiple cameras).<a name="twentytwotext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#twentytwo">22</a></sup></font> 
            Interestingly enough, this concept of &quot;stillness&quot; is also 
            present in Gnosticism, in that the higher aeons are equated with &quot;stillness&quot; 
            and &quot;rest&quot; and can only be apprehended in such a centered 
            and meditative manner, as is apparent in these instructions to a certain 
            Allogenes: &quot;And although it is impossible for you to stand, fear 
            nothing; but if you wish to stand, withdraw to the Existence, and 
            you will find it standing and at rest after the likeness of the One 
            who is truly at rest...And when you becomes perfect in that place, 
            still yourself... &quot; (Allogenes) The Gnostic then reveals, &quot;There 
            was within me a stillness of silence, and I heard the Blessedness 
            whereby I knew my proper self&quot; (Allogenes).<a name="twentythreetext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#twentythree">23</a></sup></font> 
            When Neo realizes the full extent of his &quot;saving gnosis,&quot; 
            that the Matrix is only a dreamworld, a reflective Keanu Reeves silently 
            and calmly contemplates the bullets that he has stopped in mid-air, 
            filmed in &quot;Bullet Time.&quot; <br>
            <br>
            Yet another parallel with Gnosticism occurs in the portrayal of the 
            Agents such as Agent Smith, and their opposition to the equivalent 
            of the Gnostics - that is, Neo and anyone else attempting to leave 
            the Matrix. AI created these artificial programs to be &quot;the gatekeepers 
            - they are guarding all the doors, they are holding all the keys.&quot; 
            These Agents are akin to the jealous archons created by Yaldabaoth 
            who block the ascent of the Gnostic as he/she tries to leave the material 
            realm and guard the gates of the successive levels of heaven (e.g., 
            Apocalypse of Paul).<a name="twentyfourtext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#twentyfour">24</a></sup></font><br>
            <br>
            However, as Morpheus predicts, Neo is eventually able to defeat the 
            Agents because while they must adhere to the rules of the Matrix, 
            his human mind allows him to bend or break these rules.<a name="twentyfivetext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#twentyfive">25</a></sup></font> 
            Mind, though, is not equated in the film merely with rational intelligence, 
            otherwise Artificial Intelligence would win every time. Rather, the 
            concept of &quot;mind&quot; in the film appears to point to a uniquely 
            human capacity for imagination, for intuition, or, as the phrase goes, 
            for &quot;thinking outside the box.&quot; Both the film and the Gnostics 
            assert that the &quot;divine spark&quot; within humans allows a perception 
            of gnosis greater than that achievable by even the chief archon / 
            agent of Yaldabaoth: 
          <div class="smallindented">
            <p>And the power of the mother [Sophia, in our analogy, humankind] 
              went out of Yaldabaoth [AI] into the natural body which they had 
              fashioned [the humans grown on farms by AI]... And in that moment 
              the rest of the powers [archons / Agents ] became jealous, because 
              he had come into being through all of them and they had given their 
              power to the man, and his intelligence [&quot;mind&quot;] was greater 
              than that of those who had made him, and greater than that of the 
              chief archon [Agent Smith?]. And when they recognized that he was 
              luminous, and that he could think better than they... they took 
              him and threw him into the lowest region of all matter [simulated 
              by the Matrix]. (Apocry. of John 19-20)</p>
            <span class="largeregular">
            </span> </div>
          <p class="largeregular"> It is striking that Neo overcomes Agent Smith 
            in the final showdown of the film precisely by realizing fully the 
            illusion of the Matrix, something the Agent apparently cannot do, 
            since Neo is subsequently able to break rules that the Agent cannot. 
            His final defeat of Smith entails entering Smith's body and splitting 
            him in pieces by means of pure luminosity, portrayed through special 
            effects as light shattering Smith from the inside out. <br>
            <br>
            Overall, then, the system portrayed in <i>The Matrix</i> parallels 
            Gnostic Christianity in numerous respects, especially the delineation 
            of humanity's fundamental problem of existing in a dreamworld that 
            simulates reality and the solution of waking up from illusion. The 
            central mythic figures of Sophia, Yaldabaoth, the archons and the 
            Gnostic Christ redeemer also each find parallels with key figures 
            in the film and function in similar ways. The language of Gnosticism 
            and the film are even similar: dreaming vs. waking; blindness vs. 
            seeing;<a name="twentysixtext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#twentysix">26</a></sup></font> 
            light vs. dark.<a name="twentyseventext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#twentyseven">27</a></sup></font><br>
            <br>
            However, given that Gnosticism presumes an entire unseen realm of 
            divine beings, where is God in the film? In other words, when Neo 
            becomes sheer light, is this a symbol for divinity, or for human potential? 
            The question becomes even more pertinent with the identification of 
            humankind with Sophia - a divine being in Gnosticism. On one level, 
            there appears to be no God in the film. Although there are apocalyptic 
            motifs, Conrad Ostwalt rightly argues that unlike conventional Christian 
            apocalypses, in <i>The Matrix</i> both the catastrophe and its solution 
            are of human making - that is, the divine is not apparent.<a name="twentyeighttext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#twentyeight">28</a></sup></font> 
            However, on another level, the film does open up the possibility of 
            a God through the figure of the Oracle, who dwells inside the Matrix 
            and yet has access to information about the future that even those 
            free from the Matrix do not possess. This suggestion is even stronger 
            in the original screenplay, in which the Oracle's apartment is the 
            Holy of Holies nested within the &quot;Temple of Zion.&quot;<a name="twentyninetext"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#twentynine">29</a></sup></font> 
            Divinity may also play a role in Neo's past incarnation and his coming 
            again as the One. If, however, there is some implied divinity in the 
            film,<a name="30text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#30">30</a></sup></font> 
            it remains transcendent, like the divinity of the ineffable, invisible 
            supreme god in Gnosticism, except where it is immanent in the form 
            of the divine spark active in humans.<a name="31text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#31">31</a></sup></font></p>
          <p CLASS="largeregular" align="center"><b>III. Buddhism in <i>The Matrix</i></b></p>
          <p CLASS="largeregular" align="left">When asked by a fan if Buddhist 
            ideas influenced them in the production of the movie, the Wachowski 
            brothers offered an unqualified &quot;Yes.&quot;<a name="32text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#32">32</a></sup></font> 
            Indeed, Buddhist ideas pervade the film and appear in close proximity 
            with the equally strong Christian imagery. Almost immediately after 
            Neo is identified as &quot;my own personal Jesus Christ,&quot; this 
            appellation is given a distinctively Buddhist twist. The same hacker 
            says: &quot;This never happened. You don&#146;t exist.&quot; From

            pods which encase humans in the horrific mechanistic fields to Cypher&#146;s 
            selfish desire for the sensations and pleasures of the Matrix, Buddhist 
            teachings form a foundation for much of the film&#146;s plot and imagery.<a name="34text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#34">34</a></sup></font><br>
            <br>
            <b>The Problem of Samsara.</b> Even the title of the film evokes the 
            Buddhist worldview. The Matrix is described by Morpheus as &quot;a 
            prison for your mind.&quot; It is a dependent &quot;construct&quot; 
            made up of the interlocking digital projections of billions of human 
            beings who are unaware of the illusory nature of the reality in which 
            they live and are completely dependent on the hardware attached to 
            their real bodies and the elaborate software programs created by AI 
            This &quot;construct&quot; resembles the Buddhist idea of samsara, 
            which teaches that the world in which we live our daily lives is constructed 
            only from the sensory projections formulated from our own desires. 
            When Morpheus takes Neo into the &quot;construct&quot; to teach him 
            about the Matrix, Neo learns that the way in which he had perceived 
            himself in the Matrix was nothing more than &quot;the mental projection 
            of your digital self.&quot; The &quot;real&quot; world, which we associate 
            with what we feel, smell, taste, and see, &quot;is simply electrical 
            signals interpreted by your brain.&quot; The world, Morpheus explains, 
            exists &quot;now only as part of a neural interactive simulation that 
            we call the Matrix.&quot; In Buddhist terms, we could say that &quot;because 
            it is empty of self or of what belongs to self, it is therefore said: 
            &#145;The world is empty.&#146; And what is empty of self and what 
            belongs to self? The eye, material shapes, visual consciousness, impression 
            on the eye -- all these are empty of self and of what belongs to self.&quot;<a name="35text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#35">35</a></sup></font> 
            According to Buddhism and according to <i>The Matrix</i>, the conviction 
            of reality based upon sensory experience, ignorance, and desire keeps 
            humans locked in illusion until they are able to recognize the false 
            nature of reality and relinquish their mistaken sense of identity. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Drawing upon the Buddhist doctrine of Dependent Co-Origination, the 
            film presents reality within the Matrix as a conglomerate of the illusions 
            of all humans caught within its snare. Similarly, Buddhism teaches 
            that the suffering of human beings is dependent upon a cycle of ignorance 
            and desire which locks humans into a repetitive cycle of birth, death, 
            and rebirth. The principle is stated in a short formula in the Samyutta-nikaya:</p>
          <p class="largeregular"><div class="smallindented">If this is that 
            comes to be;<br>
            from the arising of this that arises;<br>
            if this is not that does not come to be;<br>
            from the stopping of this that is stopped.<a name="36text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#36">36</a></sup></font></div>
          <p class="largeregular">The idea of Dependent Co-Origination is illustrated 
            in the context of the film through the illusion of the Matrix. The 
            viability of the Matrix&#146;s illusion depends upon the belief by 
            those enmeshed in it that the Matrix itself is reality. AI&#146;s 
            software program is, in and of itself, no illusion at all. Only when 
            humans interact with its programs do they become enmeshed in a corporately-created 
            illusion, the Matrix, or samsara, which reinforces itself through 
            the interactions of those beings involved within it. Thus the Matrix&#146;s 
            reality only exists when actual human minds subjectively experience 
            its programs.<a name="37text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#37">37</a></sup></font><br>
            <br>
            The problem, then, can be seen in Buddhist terms. Humans are trapped 
            in a cycle of illusion, and their ignorance of this cycle keeps them 
            locked in it, fully dependent upon their own interactions with the 
            program and the illusions of sensory experience which these provide, 
            and the sensory projections of others. These projections are strengthened 
            by humans&#146; enormous desire to believe that what they perceive 
            to be real is in fact real. This desire is so strong that it overcomes 
            Cypher, who can no longer tolerate the &quot;desert of the real&quot; 
            and asks to be reinserted into the Matrix. As he sits with Agent Smith 
            in an upscale restaurant smoking a cigar with a large glass of brandy, 
            Cypher explains his motives: </p>
          <p><div class="smallindented">&quot;You know, 
            I know this steak doesn&#146;t exist. I know that when I put it in 
            my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious. 
            After nine years, you know what I realize? Ignorance is bliss.&quot;<a name="38text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#38">38</a></sup></font>
           </div>
          <p class="largeregular">Cypher knows that the Matrix is not real 
          and that any pleasures he experiences there are illusory. Yet for him, 
          the &quot;ignorance&quot; of samsara is preferable to enlightenment. 
          Denying the reality that he now experiences beyond the Matrix, he uses 
          the double negative: &quot;I don&#146;t want to remember nothing. Nothing. 
          And I want to be rich. Someone important. Like an actor.&quot; Not only 
          does Cypher want to forget the &quot;nothing&quot; of true reality, 
          but he also wants to be an &quot;actor,&quot; to add another level of 
          illusion to the illusion of the Matrix that he is choosing to re-enter.<a name="39text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#39">39</a></sup></font> 
          The draw of samsara is so strong that not only does Cypher give in to 
          his cravings, but Mouse also may be said to have been overwhelmed by 
          the lures of samsara, since his death is at least in part due to distractions 
          brought on by his sexual fantasies about the &quot;woman in the red 
          dress&quot; which occupy him when he is supposed to be standing alert.<br>
          <br>
          Whereas Cypher and Mouse represent what happens when one gives in to 
          samsara, the rest of the crew epitomize the restraint and composure 
          praised by the Buddha. The scene shifts abruptly from the restaurant 
          to the mess hall of the Nebuchadnezzar, where instead of being offered 
          brandy, cigars and steak, Neo is given the &quot;bowl of snot&quot; 
          which is to be his regular meal from that point forward. In contrast 
          to the pleasures which for Cypher can only be fulfilled in the Matrix, 
          Neo and the crew must be content with the &quot;single-celled protein 
          combined with synthetic aminos, vitamins, and minerals&quot; which Dozer 
          claims is &quot;everything the body needs.&quot; Clad in threadbare 
          clothes, subsisting on gruel, and sleeping in bare cells, the crew is 
          depicted enacting the Middle Way taught by the Buddha, allowing neither 
          absolute asceticism nor indulgence to distract them from their work.<a name="40text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#40">40</a></sup></font><br>
          <br>
            <b>The Solution of Knowledge/Enlightenment.</b> This duality between 
            the Matrix and the reality beyond it sets up the ultimate goal of 
            the rebels, which is to free all minds from the Matrix and allow humans 
            to live out their lives in the real world beyond. In making this point, 
            the film-makers draw on both Theravada and Mahayana Buddhist ideas.<a name="41text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#41">41</a></sup></font> 
            Alluding to the Theravada ideal of the arhat, the film suggests that 
            enlightenment is achieved through individual effort.<a name="42text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#42">42</a></sup></font> 
            As his initial guide, Morpheus makes it clear that Neo cannot depend 
            upon him for enlightenment. Morpheus explains, &quot;No one can be 
            told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.&quot; Morpheus 
            tells Neo he must make the final shift in perception entirely on his 
            own. He says: &quot;I&#146;m trying to free your mind, Neo. But I 
            can only show you the door. You&#146;re the one that has to walk through 
            it.&quot; For Theravada Buddhists, &quot;man&#146;s emancipation depends 
            on his own realization of the Truth, and not on the benevolent grace 
            of a god or any external power as a reward for his obedient good behavior.&quot;<a name="43text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#43">43</a></sup></font> 
            The Dhammapada urges the one seeking enlightenment to &quot;Free thyself 
            from the past, free thyself from the future, free thyself from the 
            present. Crossing to the farther shore of existence, with mind released 
            everywhere, no more shalt thou come to birth and decay.&quot;<a name="44text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#44">44</a></sup></font> 
            As Morpheus says to Neo, &quot;There&#146;s a difference between knowing 
            the path and walking the path.&quot; And as the Buddha taught his 
            followers, &quot;You yourselves should make the effort; the Awakened 
            Ones are only teachers.&quot;<a name="45text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#45">45</a></sup></font> 
            As one already on the path to enlightenment, Morpheus is only a guide; 
            ultimately Neo must recognize the truth for himself.<br>
          <br>
          Yet <i>The Matrix</i> also embraces ideas found in Mahayana Buddhism, 
          especially in its particular concern for liberation for all people through 
          the guidance of those who remain in samsara and postpone their own final 
          enlightenment in order to help others as bodhisattvas.<a name="46text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#46">46</a></sup></font> 
          The crew members of the Nebuchadnezzar epitomize this compassion. Rather 
          than remain outside of the Matrix where they are safer, they choose 
          to re-enter it repeatedly as ambassadors of knowledge with the ultimate 
          goal of freeing the minds and eventually also the bodies of those who 
          are trapped within the Matrix&#146;s digital web. The film attempts 
          to blend the Theravada ideal of the arhat with the Mahayana ideal of 
          the bodhisattva, presenting the crew as concerned for those still stuck 
          in the Matrix and willing to re-enter the Matrix to help them, while 
          simultaneously arguing that final realization is an individual process.<br>
          <br>
            <b>Neo as the Buddha.</b> Although the entire crew embodies the ideals 
            of the bodhisattva, the filmmakers set Neo apart as unique, suggesting 
            that while the crew may be looked at as arhats and bodhisattvas, Neo 
            can be seen as a Buddha. Neo&#146;s identity as the Buddha is reinforced 
            not only through the anagram of his name but also through the myth 
            that surrounds him. The Oracle has foretold the return of one who 
            has the ability to manipulate the Matrix. As Morpheus explains, the 
            return of this man &quot;would hail the destruction of the Matrix, 
            end the war, bring freedom to our people. That is why there are those 
            of us who have spent our entire lives searching the Matrix, looking 
            for him.&quot; Neo, Morpheus believes, is a reincarnation of that 
            man and like the Buddha, he will be endowed with extraordinary powers 
            to aid in the enlightenment of all humanity. <br>
          <br>
            The idea that Neo can be seen as a reincarnation of the Buddha is 
            reinforced by the prevalence of birth imagery in the film directly 
            related to him. At least four incarnations are perceptible in the 
            film. The first birth took place in the pre-history of the film, in 
            the life and death of the first enlightened one who was able to control 
            the Matrix from within. The second consists of Neo&#146;s life as 
            Thomas Anderson. The third begins when Neo emerges, gasping, from 
            the gel of the eerily stupa-like pod in which he has been encased, 
            and is unplugged and dropped through a large black tube which can 
            easily be seen as a birth canal.<a name="47text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#47">47</a></sup></font> 
            He emerges at the bottom bald, naked, and confused, with eyes that 
            Morpheus tells him have &quot;never been used&quot; before. Having 
            &quot;died&quot; to the world of the Matrix, Neo has been &quot;reborn&quot; 
            into the world beyond it. Neo&#146;s fourth life begins after he dies 
            and is &quot;reborn&quot; again in the closing scenes of the film, 
            as Trinity resuscitates him with a kiss.<a name="48text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#48">48</a></sup></font> 
            At this point, Neo perceives not only the limitations of the Matrix, 
            but also the limitations of the world of the Nebuchadnezzar, since 
            he overcomes death in both realms. Like the Buddha, his enlightenment 
            grants him omniscience and he is no longer under the power of the 
            Matrix, nor is he subject to birth, death, and rebirth within AI&#146;s 
            mechanical construct.<a name="49text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#49">49</a></sup></font><br>
          <br>
          Neo, like the Buddha, seeks to be free from the Matrix and to teach 
          others how to free themselves from it as well, and any use of superhuman 
          powers are engaged to that end. As the only human being since the first 
          enlightened one who is able to freely manipulate the software of the 
          Matrix from within its confines, Neo represents the actualization of 
          the Buddha-nature, one who can not only recognize the &quot;origin of 
          pain in the world of living beings,&quot; but who can also envision 
          &quot;the stopping of the pain,&quot; enacting &quot;that course which 
          leads to its stopping.&quot;<a name="50text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#50">50</a></sup></font> 
          In this sense, he is more than his bodhisattva companions, and offers 
          the hope of awakening and freedom for all humans from the ignorance 
          that binds them. <br>
          <b><br>
          The Problem of <i>Nirvana</i>.</b> But what happens when the Matrix&#146;s 
          version of reality is dissolved? Buddhism teaches that when samsara 
          is transcended, nirvana is attained. The notion of self is completely 
          lost, so that conditional reality fades away, and what remains, if anything, 
          defies the ability of language to describe. In his re-entry into the 
          Matrix, however, Neo retains the &quot;residual self-image&quot; and 
          the &quot;mental projection of [a] digital self.&quot; Upon &quot;enlightenment,&quot; 
          he finds himself not in nirvana, or no-where, but in a different place 
          with an intact, if somewhat confused, sense of self which strongly resembles 
          his &quot;self&quot; within the Matrix. Trinity may be right that the 
          Matrix &quot;cannot tell you who you are,&quot; but who you are seems 
          to be at least in some sense related to who you think you are in the 
          Matrix. In other words, there is enough continuity in self-identity 
          between the world of the Matrix and &quot;the desert of the real&quot; 
          that it seems probable that the authors are implying that full &quot;enlightenment&quot; 
          has not yet been reached and must lie beyond the reality of the Nebuchadnezzar 
          and the world it inhabits. If the Buddhist paradigm is followed to its 
          logical conclusions, then we have to expect at least one more layer 
          of &quot;reality&quot; beyond the world of the crew, since even freed 
          from the Matrix they are still subject to suffering and death and still 
          exhibit individual egos. <br>
          <br>
            This idea is reinforced by what may be the most problematic alteration 
            which <i>The Matrix</i> makes to traditional Buddhist teachings. The 
            Buddhist doctrine of ahimsa, or non-injury to all living beings, is 
            overtly contradicted in the film.<a name="51text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#51">51</a></sup></font> 
            It appears as if the filmmakers deliberately chose to link violence 
            with salvific knowledge, since there seems to be no way that the crew 
            could succeed without the help of weaponry. When Tank asks Neo and 
            Trinity what they need for their rescue of Morpheus &quot;besides 
            a miracle,&quot; their reply is instantaneous: &quot;Guns -- lots 
            of guns.&quot; The writers could easily have presented the &quot;deaths&quot; 
            of the Agents as nothing more than the ending of that particular part 
            of the software program. Instead, the Wachowski brothers have purposefully 
            chosen to portray humans as innocent victims of the violent deaths 
            of the Agents.<a name="52text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#52">52</a></sup></font> 
            This outright violation of ahimsa stands at direct odds with the Buddhist 
            ideal of compassion.<br>
          <br>
          But why link knowledge so directly with violence? The filmmakers portray 
          violence as redemptive,<a name="53text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#53">53</a></sup></font> 
          and as absolutely essential to the success of the rebels. <i>The Matrix</i> 
          steers sharply away at this point from the shared paradigms of Buddhism 
          and Gnostic Christianity. The &quot;reality&quot; of the Matrix which 
          requires that some humans must die as victims of salvific violence is 
          not the ultimate reality to which Buddhism or Gnostic Christianity points. 
          Neither the &quot;stillness&quot; of the <i>pleroma</i> nor the unchanging 
          &quot;nothingness&quot; of <i>nirvana</i> are characterized by the dependence 
          on technology and the use of force which so characterizes both of the 
          worlds of the rebels in <i>The Matrix</i>.<br>
          <br>
          The film&#146;s explicit association of knowledge with violence strongly 
          implies that Neo and his comrades have not yet realized the ultimate 
          reality. According to the worldviews of both Gnostic Christianity and 
          Buddhism that the film evokes, the realization of ultimate reality involves 
          a complete freedom from the material realm and offers peace of mind. 
          The Wachowskis themselves acknowledge that it is &quot;ironic that Morpheus 
          and his crew are completely dependent upon technology and computers, 
          the very evils against which they are fighting.&quot;<a name="54text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#54">54</a></sup></font> 
          Indeed, the film&#146;s very existence depends upon both technology&#146;s 
          capabilities and Hollywood&#146;s hunger for violence. Negating itself, 
          <i>The Matrix</i> teaches that <i>nirvana</i> is still beyond our reach.
           
          <p class="largeregular" align="center"><b>IV. Concluding Remarks</b></p>
          <p class="largeregular">Whether we view the film from a Gnostic Christian 
            or Buddhist perspective, the overwhelming message seems to be, &quot;Wake 
            up!&quot; The point is made explicit in the final song of the film, 
            Wake Up!, by, appropriately, Rage Against the Machine. Gnosticism, 
            Buddhism and the film all agree that ignorance enslaves us in an illusory 
            material world and that liberation comes through enlightenment with 
            the aid of a teacher or guide figure. However, when we ask the question, 
            &quot;To what do we awaken?&quot;, the film appears to diverge sharply 
            from Gnosticism and Buddhism. Both of these traditions maintain that 
            when humans awaken, they leave behind the material world. The Gnostic 
            ascends at death to the pleroma, the divine plane of spiritual, non-material 
            existence, and the enlightened one in Buddhism achieves <i>nirvana</i>, 
            a state which cannot be described in language, but which is utterly 
            non-material. By contrast, the &quot;desert of the real,&quot; is 
            a wholly material, technological world, in which robots grow humans 
            for energy, Neo can learn martial arts in seconds through a socket 
            inserted into the back of his brain, and technology battles technology 
            (Nebuchadnezzar vs. AI, electromagnetic pulse vs. Sentinels). Moreover, 
            the battle against the Matrix is itself made possible through technology 
            - cell phones, computers, software training programs. &quot;Waking 
            up&quot; in the film is leaving behind the Matrix and awakening to 
            a dismal cyber-world, which is the real material world.<br>
            <br>
            Or perhaps not. There are several cinematic clues in the scene of 
            the construct loading program (represented by white space) that suggest 
            that the &quot;desert of the real&quot; Morpheus shows Neo may not 
            be the ultimate reality. After all, Morpheus, whose name is taken 
            from the god of dreams, shows the &quot;real&quot; world to Neo, who 
            never directly views the surface world himself. Rather, he sees it 
            on a television bearing the logo &quot;Deep Image.&quot; Throughout 
            the film, reflections in mirrors and Morpheus's glasses, as well as 
            images on television monitors point the viewer toward consideration 
            of multiple levels of illusion.<a name="55text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#55">55</a></sup></font> 
            As the camera zooms in to the picture on this particular television 
            and the viewer &quot;enters&quot; the image, it &quot;morphs&quot; 
            the way the surveillance screens do early in the film, indicating 
            its unreality. In addition, the entire episode takes place while they 
            stand in a construct loading program in which Neo is warned not to 
            be tricked by appearances. Although sense perception is clearly not 
            a reliable source for establishing reality, Morpheus himself admits 
            that, &quot;For a long time I wouldn't believe it, and then I saw 
            the fields [of humans grown for energy] with my own eyes... And standing 
            there, I came to realize the obviousness of the truth.&quot; We will 
            have to await the sequels to find out whether &quot;the desert of 
            the real&quot; is itself real.<a name="56text"></a><font size=-1><sup><a href="#56">56</a></sup></font><br>
            <br>
            Even if the film series does not ultimately establish a complete rejection 
            of the material realm, <i>The Matrix</i> as it stands still asserts 
            the superiority of the human capacity for imagination and realization 
            over the limited &quot;intelligence&quot; of technology. Whether stated 
            in terms of matter/ spirit, body/ mind, hardware/ software or illusion/ 
            truth, the ultimate message of <i>The Matrix </i>seems to be that 
            there may be levels of metaphysical reality beyond what we can ordinarily 
            perceive, and the film urges us to open ourselves to the possibility 
            of awakening to them. </p>

            <a name="eight"></a><a href="#eighttext">8.</a>&nbsp;In a recent interview 
            in <i>Time</i>, the Wachowskis refer to Nebuchadnezzar in this Danielic 
            context, (www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,22971,00.html 
            , &quot;Popular Metaphysics,&quot; by Richard Corliss, Time, April 
            19, 1999 Vol. 153, no. 15). Nebuchadnezzar is also the Babylonian 
            king who destroyed the Jerusalem Temple in 586 B.C.E., and who exiled 
            the elite of Judean society to Babylon. Did the Wachowski brothers 
            also intend the reference to point to the crew's &quot;exile&quot; 
            from Zion or from the surface world?<br>
            <br>
            <a name="nine"></a><a href="#ninetext">9.</a>&nbsp;The film also suggests 
            Zion is heaven, such as when Tank says, &quot;If the war was over 
            tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be,&quot; evoking the traditional 
            Christian schema of an apocalypse followed by life in heaven or paradise. 
            Ironically, the film locates Zion &quot;underground, near the Earth's 
            core, where it is still warm,&quot; which would seem to be a cinematic 
            code for hell. Is this a clue that Zion is not the &quot;heaven&quot;

          of the apartment that he enters and exits in his death / resurrection 
          scene, evoking the Trinity. This in turn raises questions about the 
          character of Trinity's relationship to Neo in terms of her cinematic

          may have had its origins in Judaism, despite its denigration of the 
          Israelite God, but the issue is complex and still debated within scholarly 
          circles. It is clear, however, that Gnostic Christianity flourished 
          from at least the 2nd - 5th c. C.E., with its own scriptures, and most 
          likely also its own distinctive rituals, entrance requirements and a 
          creation story. See Gershom Scholem,<i> Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah

          might just as well be taken from the scenes in <i>The Matrix</i> in 
          which Morpheus explains the nature of reality to Neo: Thus they [humans] 
          were<i> ignorant</i> of the Father, he being the one whom they did not<i> 
          see</i>... there were many <i>illusions</i> at work... and (there were) 
          empty fictions, <i>as if they were sunk in sleep and found themselves 
          in disturbing dreams</i>. Either (there is) a place to which they are 
          fleeing, or without strength they come (from) having chased after others, 
          or they are involved in striking blows, or they are receiving blows 
          themselves, or they have fallen from high places,<i> or they take off 
          into the air though they do not even have wings.</i> Again, sometimes 
          (it is as) if people were murdering them, though there is no one even 
          pursuing them, or they themselves are killing their neighbors...(but) 
          <i>When those who are going through all these things wake up,</i> they 
          see nothing, they who were in the midst of all these disturbances, for 
          they are nothing. Such is the way of those who have cast ignorance aside 
          from them like sleep, not esteeming it as anything, nor do they esteem 
          its works as solid things either, but<i> they leave them behind like 
          a dream in the night...</i> This is the way each one has acted, as though 
          asleep at the time when he was ignorant. And this is the way he has 
          [come to knowledge], as if he had awakened. <br>

            most evident in the subway fight between Neo and Agent Smith. At a 
            point in the film when Morpheus says of Neo, &quot;He is just beginning 
            to believe,&quot; Agent Smith calls him &quot;Mr. Anderson,&quot; 
            and while fighting he replies, &quot;My name is Neo.&quot; The Wachowskis

            a blind man (evoking blind prophets such as Tiresias) sits in the 
            lobby beneath some graffiti depicting a pair of eyes. Interestingly, 
            the Oracle - a sibyl / seer - wears glasses to look at Neo's palm.<br>

            does not work quite as well as one with Gnosticism because like Gnosticism, 
            the film understands salvation to be individual (rather than collective 
            and occurring all at once), to be attained through knowledge, and 
            most importantly to entail leaving behind the material Earth (that 
            is, not resulting in a kingdom of God made manifest on the Earth).<br>

          in the original screenplay, the Temple of Zion evokes both the Oracle 
          of Delphi (three legged stool, priestesses) and the Jerusalem Temple 
          (polished marble, empty throne which is the mercy seat or throne of 
          the invisible God).<br>

            <a name="30"></a><a href="#30text">30.</a> A viewer asked the Wachowski 
            brothers, &quot;What is the role or {sic} faith in the movie? Faith 
            in oneself first and foremost &#150; or in something else?&quot; They 
            answered, &quot;Hmmmm...that is a tough question! Faith in one's self, 
            how's that for an answer?&quot; This reply hardly settles the issue 
            (Wachowski chat).<br>
            <br>
            <a name="31"></a><a href="#31text">31.</a> Specifically, these humans 
            are Neo (the Gnostic Redeemer / Messiah) and Morpheus and Trinity, 
            both of whom are named for gods. As a godhead, this trio does not 
            quite make sense in terms of traditional Christianity. However, the 
            trio is quite interesting in the context of Gnosticism, which portrays 
            God as Father, Mother and Son, a trinity in which the Holy Spirit 
            is identified as female, e.g. <i>Apocryphon of John</i> 2:9-14. For 
            further reading on female divinities in Gnosticism, see Pagels, pp. 
            48-69.<br>
            <br>
            <a name="32"></a><a href="#32text">32.</a> The brothers explain, &quot;There's 
            something uniquely interesting about Buddhism and mathematics, particularly 
            about quantum physics, and where they meet. That has fascinated us 
            for a long time&quot; (Wachowski chat). In the Time interview with 
            Richard Corliss (see note 8), Larry Wachowski adds that they became 
            fascinated &quot;by the idea that math and theology are almost the 
            same. They begin with a supposition you can derive a whole host of 
            laws or rules from. And when you take all of them to the infinity 
            point, you wind up at the same place: these unanswerable mysteries 
            really become about personal perception. Neo's journey is affected 
            by all these rules, all these people trying to tell him what the truth 
            is. He doesn't accept anything until he gets to his own end point, 
            his own rebirth.&quot; The film&#146;s presentation of the Matrix 
            as a corporate network of human conceptions (or samsara) which are 
            translated into software codes that reinforce one another illustrates 
            this close relationship. <br>

          reference to Buddhist ideas occurs in the waiting room at the Oracle&#146;s 
          apartment, where Neo is introduced to the &quot;Potentials.&quot; The 
          screenplay describes the waiting room as &quot;at once like a Buddhist 
          temple and a kindergarten class.&quot; One of the children, clad in 
          the garb of a Buddhist monk, explains to Neo the nature of ultimate 
          reality: &quot;There is no spoon.&quot; One cannot help wondering if 
          this dictum only holds within the Matrix or if there is in fact &quot;no 
          spoon&quot; even in the real world beyond it.<br>

            upon human ignorance, so that almost all who are born into the Matrix 
            are doomed to be born, to die, and to re-enter the cycle again. When 
            asked about the film&#146;s depiction of the liquefaction of humans, 
            the Wachowskis reply that this black ooze is &quot;what they feed 
            the people in the pods, the dead people are liquefied and fed to the 
            living people in the pods.&quot; Tongue in Buddhist cheek, the brothers 
            explain this re-embodiment: &quot;Always recycle! It's a statement 
            on recycling.&quot;(Wachowski Chat) Even in the &quot;real world&quot; 
            beyond the Matrix, the human plight is depicted as a relative and 
            inter-dependent cycle of birth, death, and &quot;recycling.&quot;<br>

            actor. Therefore, the world of which both the actor Joe Pantoliano 
            and we are now a part may be seen as the &quot;Matrix&quot; into which 
            he has been successfully re-inserted, and thus the film itself may 
            be seen as a part of the software program of our own &quot;Matrix.&quot;

            <a name="40"></a><a href="#40text">40.</a> Take, for example, this

            . . . a bhikku, considering wisely, makes use of his robes -- only 
            to keep off cold, to keep off heat . . and to cover himself decently. 
            Considering wisely, he makes use of food &#150; neither for pleasure

            <a name="41"></a><a href="#41text">41.</a> James Ford has argued that 
            the film embodies in particular the Yogacara school of Buddhism. Instead 
            of pointing to that which is absolutely different than the world as 
            <i>nirvana</i>, Yogacarins point to the world itself, and through 
            the processes enacted in meditation, come to the realization that 
            &quot;all things and thought are but Mind-only. The basis of all our 
            illusions consists in that we regard the objectifications of our own 
            mind as a world independent of that mind, which is really its source 
            and substance&quot; (Edward Conze, <i>Buddhism</i>. New York: Philosophical 
            Library, 1959), p. 167. The Matrix exists only in the minds of the 
            human beings which inhabit it, so that in <i>The Matrix</i>, as in 
            Yogacara, &quot;The external world is really Mind itself&quot; (p. 
            168). Yet a problem arises when one realizes that for the Yogacara 
            school, the Mind is the ultimate reality, and therefore<i> samsara</i> 
            and <i>nirvana</i> become identified. By contrast, the film insists 
            on a <i>distinction</i> between<i> samsara</i> (the Matrix) and <i>nirvana</i> 
            (that which lies beyond it). Because <i>The Matrix</i> maintains a 
            duality between the Matrix and the realm beyond it, Yogacara is of 
            limited help in making sense of the Buddhist elements in the film, 
            nor is it helpful in supporting the idea that beyond the Matrix and 
            beyond the Nebuchadnezzar there is an ultimate reality not yet realized 
            by humans (see note 4).<br>

          <a name="42"></a><a href="#42text">42.</a> According to Theravada teachings, 
          <i>arhat</i> (&quot;Worthy One&quot;) is a title applied to those who 
          achieve enlightenment. Because, according to Theravada beliefs, enlightenment 
          can only be achieved through individual effort, an<i> arhat</i> is of 
          limited aid in helping those not yet enlightened and so would not necessarily 
          choose to re-enter <i>samsara</i> to aid others still enmeshed within 
          it.<br>

            postpones final entry into <i>nirvana</i> and willingly re-enters 
            or remains in <i>samsara</i> in order to guide others along the path 
            to enlightenment. The Buddha&#146;s compassion serves as their primary 
            model for Mahayana Buddhists, since they point out that he too remained 
            in <i>samsara</i> in order to help others achieve enlightenment through 
            his teachings and example.<br>
            <br>
            <a name="47"></a><a href="#47text">47.</a> The screenplay describes 
            Neo as &quot;floating in a womb-red amnion&quot; in the power plant.<br>
            <br>
          <a name="48"></a><a href="#48text">48.</a> In the screenplay, Trinity 
          does not kiss him but instead &quot;pounds on his chest,&quot; precipitating 
          his resuscitation. The screenplay states directly: &quot;It is a miracle.&quot; 
          This fourth &quot;life&quot; can be viewed as the one to which the Oracle 
          refers in her predictions that Neo was &quot;waiting for something&quot; 
          and that he might be ready in his &quot;next life, maybe.&quot; This 
          certainly appears to be the case, since Neo rises from the dead and 
          defeats the Agents.<br>
            <br>
            <a name="49"></a><a href="#49text">49.</a> These four &quot;lives&quot; 
            suggest that Neo is nothing other than &quot;the One&quot; foretold 
            by the oracle, the reincarnation of the first &quot;enlightened one,&quot; 
            or Buddha, who &quot;had the ability to change whatever he wanted, 
            to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.&quot; Buddhist teaching allows 
            that those who have been enlightened are endowed with magical powers, 
            since they recognize the world as illusory and so can manipulate it 
            at will. Yet supernatural powers are incidental to the primary goal, 
            which is explained in the very first sermon spoken by the Buddha: 
            &quot;The Noble Truth of the cessation of suffering is this: It is 
            the complete cessation of that very thirst, giving it up, renouncing 
            it, emancipating oneself from it, detaching oneself from it&quot;(<i>Dhammacakkappavattana-sutta</i>.

          <a name="52"></a><a href="#52text">52.</a> The idea that violence as 
          salvific is made explicit by the writers. Whereas they <i>could</i> 
          have chosen to present the &quot;deaths&quot; of the Agents as of the 
          same illusory quality as other elements within the software program, 
          instead, they choose to depict <i>actual</i> humans <i>really</i> dying 
          through the inhabitation of their &quot;bodies&quot; by the Agents. 
          This addition is completely unnecessary to the overall plot line; indeed, 
          the &quot;violence&quot; which takes place in the Hotel could still 
          be portrayed, with the reassuring belief that any &quot;deaths&quot; 
          which occur there are simply computer blips. The fact that the writers 
          so purposefully insist that actual human beings die (i.e. die also within 
          the power plant) while serving as involuntary &quot;vessels&quot; for 
          the Agents strongly argues for <i>The Matrix</i>&#146;s direct association 
          of violence with the knowledge required for salvation.<br>

            <br>
          <a name="55"></a><a href="#55text">55.</a> This is especially true in 
          the &quot;red pill / blue pill&quot; scene where Neo first meets Morpheus, 
          and Neo is reflected differently in each lens of Morpheus's glasses. 
          The Wachowskis note that one reflection represents Thomas Anderson, 
          and one represents Neo (Wachowski chat). <br>
            <br>
          <a name="56"></a><a href="#56text">56.</a> A viewer asked the pertinent 
          question of the Wachowskis: &quot;Do you believe that our world is in 
          some way similar to <i>The Matrix</i>, that there is a larger world 
          outside of this existence?&quot; They replied: &quot;That is a larger 
          question than you actually might think. We think the most important 
          sort of fiction attempts to answer some of the big questions. One of 
          the things that we had talked about when we first had the idea of <i>The 
          Matrix</i> was an idea that I believe philosophy and religion and mathematics 
          all try to answer. Which is, a reconciling between a natural world and 
          another world that is perceived by our intellect&quot; (Wachowski chat).<br>
