  element 'p', 'Shri Mataji has demonstrated many recipes for giving
self-realization.  However, she always says that giving
self-realization is more important that any particular recipe, and
she encourges us to invent our own reciples.';

  element 'p', '(Heera) i was often showered by questions that
the cool breeze may be psychological or A/C or friction.  So
when i adopted the following method, i found it fast and highly
effective in each and every case.  This recipe is mainly designed
for giving self-realization to one person at a time.';

it doesn't matter.  Give vibration for about 15 seconds.

with sensitivity.  "Rub both hands together vigorously."  Show
how to do this yourself and explain, "The easiest place to sustain

you rub your hands together, you re-sensitize yourself to vibration."

the aspirant's hands, and actively work on the vibrations of the
opposite hand with your other hand.];

The aspirant can open his or her eyes. "Spiritual fuel is needed to
have a peaceful journey of life without tension or accidents,
 so you have to fill
yourself with kundalini every day with meditation.
The more you meditate, the more spiritual fuel will collect
in your body, which will enlighten your life and make everything
more enjoyable."
You can stop working on the hand and work on the Sahasrara, or
proceed as you feel is appropriate.';
